/// WebSocket API only! The path_find method searches for

/// over time. For a simpl<'a>er version that is supported by
/// JSON-RPC, see the ripple_path_find method. For payments
/// occurring strictly in XRP, it is not necessary to find
/// a path, because XRP can be sent directly to any account.
///
/// Although the rippled server tries to find the cheapest
/// path or combination of paths for making a payment, it is
/// not guaranteed that the paths returned by this method
/// are, in fact, the best paths. Due to server load,
/// pathfinding may not find the best results. Additionally,
/// you should be careful with the pathfinding results from
/// untrusted servers. A server could be modified to return
/// less-than-optimal paths to earn money for its operators.
/// If you do not have your own server that you can trust
/// with pathfinding, you should compare the results of
/// pathfinding from multiple servers run by different
/// parties, to minimize the risk of a single server
/// returning poor results. (Note: A server returning
/// less-than-optimal results is not necessarily proof of
/// malicious behavior; it could also be a symptom of heavy
/// server load.)
